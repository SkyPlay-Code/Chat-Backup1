That my problems will be gone I mean, without her one of my load came off But still, I was suffering with regret I did reunited with Pattagobi but my heart feels very heavy Not that I want to leave her again But I don&#x27;t want anyone near me I want to spend most of my days alone because I&#x27;m a better person in that to be seen in other perspectives I&#x27;m more of a burden or maybe less for most human I don&#x27;t matter at all While for some I matter, too much Honestly before Reuniting Wait, Patagobi I was ready to die at any moment And was ready to take any risk But now, because of her I can&#x27;t die if my only wish that can come true is that to make me disappear forever And those who have my traces in their memories shall be replaced With someone or something else The only reason I am living Is because I have taken responsibility of my parents at their old age And I also have to repay them for all things they did for me And another reason is that patagobi knowing that I am disappeared She will be broken So I am only hoping that my parents, shall die as soon as Possible But happily  And Pattagobi shall hate me from bottom of her heart and find someone instead of me Then for sure I can say that I have no more work left I can die peacefully But knowing that these are not going ever happen I just want to hurt myself more and more I want to go cold like I was before I don&#x27;t need I don&#x27;t need anyone like before I hate it I hate it when my life don&#x27;t go according to me That nonexistent, so called &#x27;god&#x27; Never helped me in my life And even now if I have thought to defy that thing It&#x27;s very difficult for me I have so many thoughts I want to save all of them in an instant But why I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m writing anymore I want my wish to come true please I really don&#x27;t want to live anymore nor I want anyone to remember me\r\n\r\n19:46 11-10-2024```",

Writing can be a powerful way to express the pain, confusion, and hope within us, even when it feels like things are too heavy to bear.\n\nFrom what you wrote, it seems like you&#x27;re carrying a lot on your shoulders\u2014responsibilities to your parents, emotional connections to people like &quot;Pattagobi&quot; (probably a code name for someone special), and a deep internal struggle with your own thoughts. It sounds like you&#x27;re torn between feeling the weight of these relationships and wanting to disappear from it all. Your wish to be free from these feelings while not wanting to hurt those who care about you is such a complex and heavy burden.\n\nI want you to know that even though it feels like this darkness is swallowing you up, you&#x27;re not alone in feeling this way. These emotions, while incredibly intense, don&#x27;t have to last forever. And although it seems impossible now, there are ways to find some peace and balance with time.\n\nI know things might not go exactly the way we want them to in life, and that can be frustrating. But remember that the love and connections you have\u2014whether it&#x27;s your parents or &quot;Pattagobi&quot;\u2014also mean that there are people who care deeply about you and would want to help lighten that burden.\n\nIf you ever feel like things are becoming too much, it\u2019s important to talk to someone\u2014a close friend, a counselor, or anyone you trust\u2014so that you don\u2019t have to carry everything alone. You matter, and even when things seem bleak, there\u2019s always hope for something better ahead.\n\nI&#x27;m really sorry you&#x27;re feeling like this, and if you ever want to talk more or need someone to listen, I\u2019m here. You don&#x27;t have to go through this by yourself.",

                    "i also wrote something this morning, i know its very negative, but this actually what i want, i have also mentioned this in my previous message that i gave\n\n```\nIMAGINATION/THOUGHT\r\nWHAT I WISH\r\n\r\nOne day in school. blah what a dull start. OK now. As I started talking less to Patagobi we started to get a little just bit by bit distant so one day While I was with my other friends and Pattagobi was walking in the corridor She bumped into a boy and say it was a love at first sight The boy was very kind while patagobi heart did skip a beat but she didn&#x27;t gave it much thought about it that much and the boy helped her to get up. the next day too as I wasn&#x27;t talking to patagobi (not because something happened between us, we just have no time to talk), in recess she met that boy again and now she started to feel something, her heart was pounding and she was confused, the boy started talking about yesterday accident, the boy liked her in an instant, and she was also in a good mood, then everyday they met each other after school, during recess and games, the bond between them grew closer day by day, but patagobi was feeling kind of uncomfortable because whenever she thought about him, I got in her way (in her mind of course, because considering all the real incidents that happened between us, that I have shared to you), but as the day passed, I almost stopped talking to her and I spent my time with my gang and she too started to stop thinking about me and on next day we got into an argument (the argument was about that why I am being so rude to her and she is with someone else, and I am being myself and said a lot of mean things, even say i broke her heart by reminding her of her bad past experiences that she has told me and how she suffered them, I also knew about boy but i didn&#x27;t say anything about it), and after school she was very sad and when they met again, she told him everything, he hugged her and reassured her, and she also hugged him back very tightly, and they got even more closer than ever and they spend more time and shared many things together, as the day passed i slowly stopped coming to school because not much time was left for boards and i needed to study so i stayed at home, and many more students started to stop coming, now both of them have much more time together without worrying abut anyone seeing them, and after school when they were together alone, the boy held patagobi in a romantic way (maybe i have told you the ways she wants me to hold her, you know like all those romantic movie scenes, she is more into like those of things, so yeah he held her in one of the way she wanted from her lover), which made her heart race very fast and so the boy heart was racing, but it was so good that they kissed warmly and passionately, but patagobi was really upset and said that it wasn&#x27;t her first kiss, and she really wish that she could have saved that for hum but he reassured her and said that it doesn&#x27;t matter as they are together now, and time passed i gave boards exam, and as you already in real life that i need to change school for my higher studies while she is going to stay there, now continuing, as the boards i never saw her again, because she was with her lover, he also met her parents and confessed everything or more likely say, he impressed both of them, and both parents also liked him so as the 10th ended i left the school and both of them stayed together forever, oh i forgot to mention that after kiss, patagobi was so shy and her heart was racing so fast that she almost fainted.\r\nBut you know, I was happy, because from start i thought that this boy might be the true love that she was looking for, so i intentionally made him to do things or say i was the one to send him to her, and so i also intentionally ignored her and did the argument so she will hate me from the bottom of her heart so that she will never think of again. After all this i graduated, went to college, various schools and places but i never fell in love again, because she was the one that i wanted the most, but i also wanted her to be happy forever and stay with someone that is better than me and can take care of her. For me, her happiness was more important than her itself. Now, a weight is removed from me, I am free and i can die peacefully, not peacefully but i don&#x27;t know, i wont have so much burden while dying i guess. also, after hearing that she and him are a couple now, Sonali(her 2nd bestest friend, i was 1st) and Pratik(my friend and also his brother, not blood related, she just tied him Rakhi so he is her brother, but their bond is very good like actual brother and sister) were very shocked to hear that because both of them knew about us(me and patagobi) and so they thought we were the one to love each other, they were surely shocked but they were also happy at the same time, because someone is finally there to love her. \r\nYeah that was my imagination, and so i hope that it will actually come true someday, not everything in detail like I imagined but i wish that she shall get strength and have someone else much better than me that can take care of her and she can live with him forever happily, that&#x27;s the only thing i want.\r\n\r\n07:14 12-10-2024```",

                    "This writing reveals so much about how you deeply care for Pratiksya\u2019s happiness, even if it means letting her go in your imagination. The story is filled with selflessness\u2014your wish for her to find love and happiness with someone who can take care of her, even though it would cause you pain. It shows how much you value her well-being, sometimes to the point of feeling like you&#x27;d be willing to disappear to make her life easier. \n\nIt&#x27;s understandable that you might be feeling conflicted. On one hand, you love her and want to be with her, but on the other, you seem to believe that she might be happier without you in the picture. The idea of her moving on and finding happiness with someone else is difficult, but it also highlights the weight you&#x27;re carrying\u2014wanting her to be happy, even at the cost of your own.\n\nThese thoughts are heavy, and it&#x27;s clear that they are linked to the struggles you&#x27;re dealing with internally. It\u2019s okay to feel these emotions, but it&#x27;s important to remember that your feelings and your presence do matter. Pratiksya cares for you and values you, and you have been a huge source of support for each other.\n\nIf you ever feel overwhelmed by these thoughts, it might help to talk them out or consider reaching out for support, whether it\u2019s a close friend or someone else you trust. You deserve to feel valued, too, not just by others but also by yourself.\n\nIs there anything specific you&#x27;d like to explore from this writing? Whether it\u2019s about the weight of these feelings or how you see the future, I\u2019m here to help.",

                    "I can sense the deep emotional turmoil and complexity in both pieces of writing. It seems like you&#x27;re grappling with conflicting feelings of wanting isolation, yet being deeply connected to others\u2014especially to Pratikshya. You also seem to be carrying an overwhelming sense of responsibility for others&#x27; happiness, even to the point of wanting to distance yourself for their sake.\n\n### On *&quot;My Life&quot;*\n\nThis piece reveals how much weight you feel in your life\u2014the pressure from your parents, the emotional complexity with Pratikshya, and the burden of loneliness despite being surrounded by people. It&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re feeling stuck between wanting to disappear and staying alive out of obligation. The writing reflects a constant inner battle between the desire to escape pain and the sense of duty to those who love you. It also shows that you&#x27;ve felt isolated for a long time, even before meeting Pratikshya.\n\nA line that stands out to me is how you said, &quot;I just want to hurt myself more and more,&quot; which shows how much you&#x27;re struggling. That feeling of wanting to push people away to stop being a burden is tough, and it&#x27;s something many people in deep pain feel. However, this mindset can be dangerous because it leads to further isolation when you most need support. I feel like the sense of *responsibility*\u2014toward your parents, Pratikshya, and even yourself\u2014is what&#x27;s keeping you going, even though it also feels heavy.\n\n### On *&quot;Imagination/Thought: What I Wish&quot;*\n\nThis piece seems like a fantasy born out of self-sacrifice. You imagine creating distance with Pratikshya, even hoping she finds someone else, so that you can leave her life without her ever feeling hurt. The way you described her finding happiness with another person reflects your belief that she deserves someone \u201cbetter\u201d than you. At the same time, it shows how deeply you care for her, to the point where her happiness is more important to you than your own.\n\nIn this imagination, you essentially disappear from her life, sacrificing your feelings so she can move on. This aligns with how, in *&quot;My Life,&quot;* you talk about not wanting to be a burden or remembered. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re envisioning a way to remove yourself to relieve others&#x27; pain, thinking that your absence would eventually lead to their happiness. The ending, where you describe being &quot;free&quot; and able to die without a burden, highlights the deep exhaustion you&#x27;re feeling\u2014it&#x27;s like you want to escape not only your situation but life itself.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n\nBoth writings reveal the depth of your emotions and show that you&#x27;re in a place of intense inner conflict. You\u2019re torn between caring for others and feeling like you don\u2019t deserve that care in return. It&#x27;s heartbreaking because, despite the love and concern you have for Pratikshya, you don\u2019t seem to feel like you\u2019re worthy of that same kind of love and care. You\u2019re imagining her with someone else who could give her the things you believe you can&#x27;t, but that isn\u2019t true. The qualities that make you care for her so deeply are already part of who you are\u2014and they&#x27;re valuable. \n\nI sense that a lot of your pain comes from feeling like a burden or that you don\u2019t matter, but from everything you\u2019ve written, it&#x27;s clear that you *do* matter, both to the people in your life and in a larger sense. You have a deep well of love and care within you, even if you struggle to extend that same kindness to yourself.\n\nOne thing that strikes me is the idea of wanting to &quot;disappear&quot; rather than truly confront what you&#x27;re feeling. The self-sacrificing fantasy is a way to protect Pratikshya from pain, but it also cuts you off from the possibility of your own healing. While your imagination offers a sense of relief or peace, the reality is that you *deserve* to find happiness and peace too, not just push others toward it while leaving yourself in the shadows.\n\nIf you were to consider this from another perspective: What if Pratikshya knew how deeply you felt this? What would you want her to say or do for you? What would you want for yourself in this situation if you could change something?\n\nThese thoughts you\u2019re expressing, even though dark and heavy, show that you\u2019re thoughtful, compassionate, and introspective. And with those qualities, there\u2019s always hope for things to change, even if it feels impossible right now.",

                    "I\u2019m really glad you shared all of this\u2014it shows just how complex and painful these emotions are, and it takes courage to express them. What you\u2019re feeling is deeply heavy, and it\u2019s clear that the weight of responsibility toward your parents and Pratikshya is what\u2019s keeping you here, even though you struggle with the desire to leave.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that you feel stuck. You want to repay your parents for everything they\u2019ve done, and at the same time, you feel responsible for Pratikshya\u2019s happiness and well-being. That sense of being tied to these responsibilities can be overwhelming because it makes you feel like your own desires don\u2019t matter, even though they\u2019re equally important.\n\nThe fact that you consider self-harm, or even worse thoughts like wanting to hurt someone else, shows just how much inner pain you\u2019re carrying. It\u2019s important to recognize that this pain is real and valid, but hurting yourself isn\u2019t a solution\u2014it only deepens the cycle of pain. It can make the feelings of worthlessness worse, and over time, it can affect how you see yourself. Right now, you\u2019re taking on a lot, and it\u2019s understandable that the pressure is so intense you feel like you need some kind of release. But there are ways to cope with this pain that don\u2019t involve hurting yourself.\n\nWhat I hear in your words is that you\u2019re torn between these two extremes: on one hand, you have this deep care and responsibility for others, and on the other, a feeling that your own life doesn\u2019t matter much. The truth is that *your life* does matter\u2014your pain matters, and your happiness matters. It\u2019s important to find ways to share that burden, to let someone (even if it\u2019s not Pratikshya, but a friend, a counselor, or someone else) know that you\u2019re carrying so much weight inside.\n\nThe love and care you have for Pratikshya, for your parents, is real and valuable, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to bear everything alone. Sometimes it feels like it\u2019s your responsibility to take care of others, but the people who love you would also want you to take care of yourself. Your life isn\u2019t just about serving others\u2014you deserve to live a life where you can find peace and happiness too.\n\nHave you ever considered talking to someone professionally about these feelings? It\u2019s not about making you feel \u201cwrong\u201d for what you\u2019re going through but about finding ways to lighten the burden you\u2019re carrying. Sometimes just having someone to guide you through those intense emotions can make a huge difference.\n\nAlso, have you been able to find things\u2014small moments, hobbies, or activities\u2014that give you a sense of calm or relief, even for a short while?",

It&#x27;s also important to recognize that, while your friends Jyoti and Megha may not fully grasp your emotional challenges, they still offer you some level of support, which is valuable. Similarly, with Pratikshya, you respect her struggles by not burdening her with heavier emotional issues.\n\nI can see that your sense of responsibility is deeply tied to your parents and Pratikshya, and while that keeps you grounded, it also seems to add weight to your feelings of being trapped. The idea of channeling your internal conflicts into self-harm might feel like an outlet, but I believe there are better ways to express and cope with those feelings.

I dont really want her to say anything, if i am this much sad then i just want to sit beside or maybe hug her.

The thought of her knowing how deeply you feel could lead to a mix of emotions\u2014concern for you, confusion about how to help, and maybe even a sense of helplessness given her own challenges. You\u2019re aware of how your struggles could impact her, and it\u2019s clear that you care deeply about her well-being.\n\nWanting her to simply be there with you, to share a moment of comfort without needing to fix anything, speaks volumes about your connection. It\u2019s about feeling understood and supported in silence, which can sometimes be more healing than words.\n\nYour desire to change the situations of those you care about\u2014whether it\u2019s improving family dynamics or wanting Pratikshya to be stronger and more independent\u2014shows your deep sense of empathy. You see her pain and want to alleviate it, even if it means stepping back from your own feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s also understandable to feel that you might be a burden to her. It\u2019s important to remember that relationships are built on mutual support; being there for one another doesn\u2019t always mean carrying each other\u2019s burdens. It\u2019s okay to share your struggles without feeling like you\u2019re adding to hers.\n\nIf you had the opportunity to express this to Pratikshya, what do you think you\u2019d want to say to her about your feelings, while still respecting her own challenges? Would there be a way to communicate your care for her while also expressing your own need for support?",

It\u2019s tough when you want to be there for someone you care about but feel like you\u2019re not able to show it in the way you want. \n\nYour instinct to avoid adding to her worries is understandable, especially given how much she\u2019s dealing with. Sometimes, people express care in different ways\u2014through humor, light-hearted conversations, or even sharing small moments of joy. Even if it feels like you\u2019re just talking about non-sense things, those moments can still help maintain a connection, even if they don\u2019t directly address the deeper issues.\n\nYou might consider small gestures of care that don\u2019t require heavy conversations. For instance, asking how her day went, sharing a funny meme, or even discussing a book or movie you both enjoy could help reinforce your connection without diving into the emotional weight. This way, you can still show her that you\u2019re thinking of her without overwhelming her.\n\nIf you ever feel comfortable, you could try expressing your care in a simpler way, like a note or a message that acknowledges you\u2019re there for her, even if you\u2019re not discussing deep feelings. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect; sometimes, just showing up as you are can be enough. \n\nWhat do you think about taking small steps in that direction?",

                    "so its the time of nearly end of October when half yearly exams were approaching in 9th the year was 2023 of course, at that time I was learning about manipulating peoples from the book 48 laws of power and dark psychology, but I wanted someone to test on, I needed a girl to test the things I wanted, at that time I have a best friend named Pratik, I have mentioned his name before in my message &quot;sonali and Pratik...&quot;, so as I have already described the pratikshya was Pratik sister so from him i was able to contact pratikshya, more likely i lured her to talk to me, one day after exams were ended she called me and we talked about 1hour 10min, i perfectly remember and we were talking about her past bad experience, like how her boyfriend make her felt, how they got caught, how much she suffered, how that boy left her and she was so sad, i comforted her and so she gained my trust, now there was also a task given for group project so i also added her in the group so i can get close to her and so i did, i became very close sometimes i patted her head and rubbed her back when she was scared, and after all these i started to walk her through different emotions from different actions to confirm my that my testing is going good, i almost walked her through every emotion, excitement, happy, sad, nervous, heart broken, bright shine, pretty much every one you say, then as my final exams approached, i started to ignore her, not because i was being disturbed i studies but my testing/experiment was over and at that time she was just a test-subject to me, my grades got very down from 8th 96% to in 9th 84% so i never talked to her again, one of my biggest regret is that, because my birthday falls during the time of final examination i never able celebrate it, and no one ever gave a gift to me, at that time she was going to give me my life first ever gift, but i ignored her and her gift, and now i am never going to get one because i will leave 10th in February after giving boards in February, i will directly shift to new school, so i am not going to get a gift, now that at the time of leaving her i was surely very selfish but i also thought why to ruin her life, she has her own rights to live so i thought leaving her is the best choice, but months passed in 10th, i was suffering in regret both about my birthday gift(because its not a normal one, its from someone special, from someone that i love) and i left her, in august 25, 2024, the day of her birthday, i gathered all the courage and wished her birthday like just as the clock hit 12:01 am, she said she was waiting for me all the time, she thought that i wont wish her, but i did, with so much affection, not like simply but with affection and as i met her on the next day in school i realized that i was actually in love with her, and to lessen my burden of regret i should spend the remaining time of 10th with her, so now this is us that you see now\r\nbut i still regret for my gift a lot",

After developing a close bond through emotional support and comfort, he ignored her as his final exams approached, viewing her as a test subject. He regrets this, especially since he missed receiving a special birthday gift from her. After some months, he reached out to her on her birthday (August 25, 2024), realizing he was in love with her.

                    "Thank you for sharing your story. It\u2019s clear you have deep feelings for Pratikshya and a lot of complex emotions surrounding your past actions and regrets. Here are my thoughts on both pieces you wrote:\n\n### On &quot;MY LIFE&quot;:\n- **Vulnerability**: You express a lot of vulnerability and self-awareness, which is important. It&#x27;s tough to navigate such heavy feelings, especially about relationships and personal struggles.\n- **Heavy Emotions**: It\u2019s evident that you feel burdened by your responsibilities towards your parents and Pratikshya. The conflict between wanting to alleviate their pain and your own suffering is palpable. \n- **Seeking Isolation**: Your inclination towards solitude is understandable, especially when you feel like a burden. However, remember that seeking connection, even in small ways, can sometimes alleviate feelings of isolation.\n\n### On &quot;IMAGINATION/THOUGHT - WHAT I WISH&quot;:\n- **Imagining a Happy Future for Pratikshya**: Your desire for Pratikshya to find happiness, even if it\u2019s not with you, speaks volumes about how much you care for her. It shows that you value her well-being over your own feelings, which is a selfless trait.\n- **Storytelling**: The narrative you created reflects your fears of losing her and your hopes for her future. It\u2019s a powerful way to process your feelings, even if it feels negative.\n- **Acceptance of Your Role**: It seems you\u2019ve come to terms with your perceived shortcomings in her life. This acceptance can be both liberating and painful, and it reflects your complex emotional landscape.\n\n### Reflection on Your Feelings:\n- It\u2019s important to acknowledge that while you feel a deep responsibility toward your parents and Pratikshya, you also need to care for yourself. Finding a balance can be challenging, but it\u2019s essential for your mental health.\n- The regrets you have about your past actions are part of being human. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re able to reflect on them, but it\u2019s also crucial to allow yourself some grace. You\u2019ve learned from these experiences, which can help guide your future actions.\n- Your desire to keep Pratikshya from feeling burdened by your struggles shows your love and care for her. However, opening up, even a little, can strengthen your bond. It\u2019s okay to share parts of yourself with her, as long as you feel it\u2019s the right time.\n\nUltimately, you\u2019re navigating a lot of complex emotions, and it\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Remember, it\u2019s okay to seek help, whether through friends, trusted adults, or professionals. You\u2019re not alone in this, and your feelings are valid.",

                    "Dealing with regret, especially regarding missed opportunities like the birthday gift from Pratikshya, can be challenging, but there are a few ways you can approach it:\n\n1. **Express Your Feelings**: If you feel comfortable, you might consider sharing your feelings about that missed gift with Pratikshya. You could tell her how much it meant to you and how you regret not being there to celebrate your birthday with her. This openness can help you both connect on a deeper level.\n\n2. **Make New Memories**: While you can\u2019t change the past, you can create new memories with her. Plan something special for her upcoming birthday or any occasion that\u2019s meaningful to both of you. It can be a small gesture, like a heartfelt letter, a thoughtful gift, or simply spending quality time together.\n\n3. **Write a Letter**: If expressing your feelings directly is difficult, consider writing a letter to her. You can pour out your thoughts, including your regret about the gift, and share how important she is to you. You don\u2019t have to give it to her, but writing it can help you process your feelings.\n\n4. **Focus on the Present**: Concentrate on the relationship you have now. Engage in meaningful conversations, support each other through challenges, and cherish the moments you share. Building a strong present can help alleviate the pain of past regrets.\n\n5. **Learn from It**: Reflect on this experience and how it can inform your future actions. Use it as motivation to express appreciation for others and to be present in your relationships moving forward.\n\n6. **Forgive Yourself**: It\u2019s essential to forgive yourself for past mistakes. Everyone makes choices they regret, and what matters is how you choose to move forward. Be kind to yourself and recognize that you\u2019ve learned and grown from this experience.\n\nUltimately, focusing on your current connection with Pratikshya and finding ways to express your feelings can help you move past the regret. It&#x27;s about cherishing what you have now rather than dwelling on what you missed in the past.",

                    "I understand that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by your regrets and the pressures surrounding your situation. It\u2019s completely normal to feel this way, especially when you believe you\u2019ve missed out on a significant moment like receiving a gift from Pratikshya. Here are some thoughts tailored to your feelings:\n\n1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It\u2019s okay to feel upset about the past. You\u2019re dealing with complex emotions regarding your relationship and your family circumstances. Allow yourself to feel those emotions without judgment.\n\n2. **Focus on What You Can Control**: While it\u2019s understandable that you feel like you can\u2019t celebrate birthdays due to exams and transitions, you might still be able to find small ways to acknowledge those days without a full celebration. For instance, maybe a simple message or a call can help keep the connection alive, even if it\u2019s not a grand celebration.\n\n3. **Shift the Narrative**: Instead of seeing your past as a lost opportunity, try to view it as a learning experience. Think about how this has shaped your current relationship with Pratikshya. You\u2019ve come back into each other&#x27;s lives, and that\u2019s something meaningful.\n\n4. **Let Go of the Need for Perfection**: Relationships don\u2019t need to be perfect. Sometimes, just being there for each other, even in simple ways, can mean a lot. You don\u2019t need a grand gesture to show you care. Small, genuine acts can also convey your feelings.\n\n5. **Talk to Someone You Trust**: If you feel comfortable, it might help to talk to a close friend or someone you trust about your feelings. Sometimes sharing your burden with someone can lighten it.\n\n6. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be gentle with yourself. Remember, everyone has moments they regret. What matters is how you choose to move forward. Instead of lecturing yourself, try to remind yourself that you are doing your best with the circumstances you have.\n\n7. **Stay Present**: While it\u2019s easy to get caught up in what you\u2019ve lost or missed, try to stay focused on the present. Concentrate on your studies and the time you do have with Pratikshya. Every interaction can help strengthen your bond.\n\n8. **Consider Future Connections**: After your boards, when you move to a new school, you may find new ways to connect with people. You might have opportunities to celebrate new friendships and relationships, and this can bring new joy into your life.\n\nYour feelings about missing the birthday gift are valid, but it\u2019s important to focus on what\u2019s happening now and how you can nurture your relationship with Pratikshya moving forward. It\u2019s a journey, and you\u2019re not alone in navigating these complex emotions.",

Sometimes, just letting it out can provide a bit of relief. If you feel comfortable, here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. **Allow Yourself to Cry**: If you feel the urge to cry, let yourself do it. Sometimes crying can help release pent-up emotions and make you feel a little lighter.\n\n2. **Write It Out**: If you don\u2019t want to talk, try writing down your feelings. Expressing what\u2019s in your heart on paper can sometimes make it easier to process those emotions.\n\n3. **Take a Break**: Step away from this conversation for a bit. Do something that usually brings you comfort, like listening to music, reading, or playing with your Rubik\u2019s Cube.\n\n4. **Deep Breaths**: Try taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Repeat this a few times. It can help calm your mind and body.\n\n5. **Reach Out**: If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to someone you trust. Sometimes just having someone listen can make a big difference.\n\n6. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember, it\u2019s okay to feel sad, and it\u2019s okay to not have everything figured out. You\u2019re navigating a lot right now, and that\u2019s a lot for anyone to handle.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and I\u2019m here if you want to talk or share more about how you\u2019re feeling. Take your time, and be gentle with yourself.",
